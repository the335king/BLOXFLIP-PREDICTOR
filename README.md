# BLOXFLIP-PREDICTOR
🚀 Getting Started
To dive into the world of accurate predictions, simply download the latest release and unleash the power of Bloxflip Predictor.

ℹ️ What is Bloxflip Predictor?
Bloxflip Predictor harnesses the capabilities of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), drawing inspiration from the intricate workings of the human brain. ANNs, comprised of interconnected "neurons," can process vast amounts of data and make predictions by identifying meaningful patterns. This technology, fundamental to Bloxflip Predictor, is widely used in diverse applications such as image recognition, natural language processing, and predictive modeling.

❗ False Positives: A Brief Note
False positives can occasionally occur due to outdated virus definitions or heuristic analysis misinterpreting program behavior. Depending on your antivirus software, you might need to temporarily disable it to ensure smooth operation.
